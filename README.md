Programming Style Examples (Python)
===================================

These are a few examples to support a discussion about programming approaches.  They all
just load up a CSV and print out some data from it.  The point is to demonstrate various
approaches to programming in a small way.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have Python 2.6 or 2.7 installed.  Might work with Python 3 (I haven't tried it).

Use
---

Run each scripts like this:
```
python imperative.py
```

The examples included show each of these styles:
* imperative
* procedural
* object-oriented
* event-driven (not that well)
* functional
* test-driven
